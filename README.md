# !WARNING - DO NOT RUN THIS PROGRAM - YES, IT WORKS!

This ransomeware will work on any OS, it will recursively go through and encrypt all of the files that can be encrypted. The encryption algorthm utilises the Affine, Null, and Rails Fence Cipher. The product cipher is executed three times.

Once the process is complete, a simple GUI will open that gives the user the decryption key. There is a small textfield, once the decryption key is entered in the textfield, it will execute the decryption product cipher on each encrypted file.
